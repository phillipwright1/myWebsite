                            <p>After being involved in just about every sport since the age of 4, one would think
                                I knew all about teamwork and its capabilities, but, no. I didn’t know about the
                                prerequisite skills required to be on a functional team, including the ability to
                                communicate, organize, and adhering to deadlines, nor did I realize how much effort
                                it takes to be a part of a really good team; now, I do. I am currently attending a
                                coding boot camp that has been teaching me so much more than just how to code, but it
                                has been integral in teaching me to persevere through whatever the task is at hand, and,
                                an even bigger factor, is learning how not only to be a good teammate but to reciprocate
                                that I am a contributing teammate/collaborator in something bigger than just a "project."
                                This experience has shown me that team building and maintenance is a bonding mechanism.
                                Because we are all working toward our individual professional goals, never in a million
                                years did I think I would be included in such a strong and intelligent group of people
                                like the teammates and fellow students I have encountered at Coding House.

                                We are currently starting on the biggest project that I have ever been involved with.
                                We will be building a web application for AT&T, from the ground up, and I can’t wait to
                                get my hands dirty and learn more than many folks could imagine. My experience in web
                                design began with something a little less complex, my football fundamentals project (this
                                can be found in my portfolio on my web-page). I built this particular application to teach
                                the fundamentals of the risks of football for kids that are currently participating or
                                thinking about participating in the sport. As a child, I broke my femur when I was in
                                third grade, trying to tackle another player twice my size. Though the differing sizes
                                may have been a contributing factor to my broken leg, I believe the poor coaching and
                                lack of knowledge of how to properly position my body during gameplay had much more to
                                do with the injury taking place. With this application, though I realize one cannot stop
                                fate, and in this day and age, there is enough knowledge available that some of these
                                injuries could be avoided.
