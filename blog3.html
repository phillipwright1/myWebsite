                    <p>Saturday morning, as the team and I rose with the sun,
                       we knew not what lay ahead of us. We drove deep into the
                        Redwood forest, ready to track up and down hills and
                        uncharted lands as a team with our hands full of features
                        for our air-soft (hard) guns to cause nothing less than
                        chaos and confusion. It wasn't until that trek into the
                        woods, that I realized just how fun this adventure was
                        going to be, when we witnessed three deer, a mountain lion,
                        the combination of the two (not good), and we also got to
                        see an old redwood tree take a plunge to its final resting
                        place. Then we got out of the truck.

                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>

                        As we marched deeper into these beasts known as the Redwoods,
                        the only thing I could keep thinking about was how small we as
                        people really are in this giant world. We split the teams up as
                        evenly as we could and got started with the madness. From when
                        the starting pistol went off until the end, we were running
                        stealthily, jumping over wooded terrain, diving for coverage,
                        and shooting folks on the other team as best we could. It was
                        like a scene out of Black Ops the video game. Every chance I
                        got, I dove in the bushes trying to escape the wrath that was
                        upon me. Ultimately, I ended up getting shot in the head at least
                        three times: one from close range and the other two which felt
                        closer than they actually were.

                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>WAfter the madness had concluded, we sat around a "city camp fire,"
                        in other words a head lamp under a cup, and shared stories that
                        we had lived through and a few more ghost tales we had also acquired
                        over the years. I was surprised at how we, people at a crossroads
                        with so many different histories and paths, ended up bonding like no
                        other relationship I had experienced yet this lifetime, strengthening
                        our capacity as a team. After the story time ended, our group slept on
                        the bare ground, with the purpose of learning the meaning of perseverance
                        , the hard way. I woke up at about 4:00 a.m., checked my phone and
                        realized the temperature had dropped to forty-seven degrees. As I scanned
                        the campsite, I noticed I wasn't the only one shaking like a leaf in the
                        frigid air. I have never been that cold for that long. Finally, when
                        everyone else started getting up and around, it was close to 7:00 a.m.
                        There was a shaking contest for nearly twenty minutes amongst us all,
                        only alleviated by when we cleaned up the campsite. As we had a small
                        yet delicious breakfast, and then packed the equipment in the truck, I
                        couldn't help thinking what a valuable learning experience this was.
                        It taught us much about working as a team and blocking out adversity,
                        or at least using it to an advantage. Moving forward, I would do it again
                        with the same group of characters, any day of the week, though, after
                        reflection, I believe we can pack sleeping bags this time, have a real
                        fire, and maybe tote along a tent or two.
